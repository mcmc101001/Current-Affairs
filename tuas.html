                    <h3 id="UNCLOS"> UNCLOS </h3>
                    <p> The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is an international agremeent which establishes the framework for marine and maritime activities. Of note, UNCLOS states that every state is entitled to 12 nautical miles of territorial waters (waters which the state has jurisdiction over) off its coast. However, for states with a narrow waterway in between, for example between Singapore and Malaysia, territorial waters cannot exceed the midway point (note: not very accurate but a sufficient generalisation), unless there is an agreement. </p>

                    <h3 id="Port Limits"> Port Limits </h3>
                    <p> Port limits, put simply, demarcate the area of water in which port authorities can regulate the movement of vessels. Therefore by extension, it has to be within the territorial waters of a nation. </p>
                    <p> The image belows shows the different maritime boundaries between Singapore and Malaysia near Tuas prior to Malaysia's extension of port limits on 25 Oct 2018. </p>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p> Notably, the territorial waters boundaries between Malaysia and Singapore was agreed in 1995 as indicated by the red line. The boundaries closely follow the Straits Settlement and Johore Territorial Waters Agreement of 1927 between the British colonial ruler of Singapore and the Sultanate of Johor.</p>
                    <p> Meanwhile, the rest of the boundaries have not been agreed between Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysia published a map in 1979 indicating the territorial waters of Malaysia, which Singapore has not accepted. From the map, we cann see that Singapore had reclaimed land in the Tuas area, over areas of waters claimed by Malaysia. Elsewhere to the right of Singapore (off the map), the 1979 map also claims Pedra Branca as Malaysian territory, which is another point of contention between Singapore and Malaysia. </p>
                    <p> Singapore demarcated its Tuas port limits in 1997, while Malaysia extended its JB port limits in 1999 up to the 1979 line. </p>

                    <h3 id="Malaysia's Port Limit Extension"> Malaysia's Port Limit Extension </h3>
                    <p> On 25 Oct 2018, Malaysia published a Federal Government Gazette, extending the JB port limits past the 1979 line, up to Singapore's Tuas port limits. Later, they released a port circular and notice to mariners (NTM) regarding the change in port limits. Meanwhile, Singapore issued two diplomatic notes to Malaysia protesting the change to port limits. Singapore also published a Port Marine Circular informing vessels to disregard Malaysia's newly drawn port limits.</p>

                    <h3 id="Singapore's Port Limit Extension"> Singapore's Port Limit Extension </h3>
                    <p> On 6 Dec 2018, Singapore then extended its own port limits up to the 1979 line, thus overlapping with Malaysia's newly extended JB port limits. The overlapping of port limits is a significant event, as it creates a confusing and dangerous situation, with two conflicting set of rules to follow. There is also a risk of further escalation in the area. </p>

                    <h3 id="Malaysian Vessels Presence"> Malaysian Vessels Presence </h3>
                    <p> Several Malaysian vessels intruded into the disputed waters, most notably with buoy-laying vessels MV Polaris and MV Pedoman (yes that's the name) being parked in the waters. This is particularly significant as buoy-laying vessels are usually used to mark territory or safety hazards. Johor's then Menteri Besar (head of government for Johor) Osman Sapain also visited MV Pedoman while it was in the disputed area. There was also an incident on 9 Feb 2019, where there was a collision betwen MV Polaris with Greek-registered ship Piraeus in the disputed area. </p>
                    <h2 id="Aftermath"> Aftermath </h2>
                    <p> On 14 Mar 2019, Singapore and Malaysia agreed to suspend implementation of the overlapping port limits and follow the implementation prior to 25 Oct 2018. </p>
