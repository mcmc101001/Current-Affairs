                    <p class="lead word-wrap"> Israel and Palestine have been at conflict for decades. However, the current situation does not look anywhere conducive for a peace process and the conflict to conclude. Palestine itself is also fractured into 2 main factions, Fatah in the West Bank and the more radical Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Many organisations, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) (both of which are funded by Iran), have conducted many attacks against Israel.</p>

<!--Deets-->
                <div class = "deets">
                    <h2 id="Gaza Strip"> Gaza Strip </h2>
                    <p>Israel and Hamas have been intermittently at war multiple times over the years. Hamas has launched rockets, mortars, incendiary ballons and explosive-laden drones towards Israel, and also launced attacks within Israel, including kidnappings. Israel have responded with assassinations, air strikes and ground offensives into the Gaza Strip. However, the death toll of these clashes have always been disproportionate, with a Palestinian majority. Israel possess a far superior military with advanced technology. For example, its Iron Dome missile defence system (which Singapore reportedly bought) is highly effective with a success rate of more than 90%. However, it must be noted that the interceptor missiles and operational costs of the Iron Dome far exceed that of the cheap homemade Qassam rockets which Hamas fires indiscriminately into population centres of Israel. Israel also possesses a far superior air power compared to Hamas' non-existent fleet, allowing Israel to exercise air superiority and conduct precision strikes targeting Hamas rocket sites. However, the civilian death toll of such strikes far exceed that of Hamas rockets, leading to international condemnation against Israel.</p>
                    <h3 id="Blockade of Gaza"> Blockade of Gaza </h3>
                    <p>Since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip, it has been placed under a land and naval blockade by Israel and Egypt (so 15 years and counting). The blockade has prevented economic and infrastructure development in the Gaza Strip and created a worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, with an unemployment and poverty rate exceeding 50%. Further conflict between Hamas and Israel have also exarcebated this crisis.</p>
                    <h3 id="Tunnels"> Tunnels </h3>
                    <p> Hamas possesses an extensive set of tunnels under the Gaza Strip, allowing for transport and movement of equipment and personnel safely. These tunnels have also reportedly been used for infiltration into Israel. Possessing a set of tunnels also allow Hamas to hide its ammunition and keep it away from Israeli aerial detection. </p>
                    <h2 id="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</h2>
                    <p>Jerusalem is one of the holiest cities in the world, being of importance to Judaism, Christianity and Islam. East Jerusalem is regarded by Palestinians as the capital of Palestine (as per the boundaries after the 1948 war), while Israel claims the entirety of Jerusalem as their capital. As a result, Jerusalem is a contentious area. Clashes between ultra-orthodox leftists and Palestinians happen frequently in the city. </p>
                    <h3 id="Temple Mount">Temple Mount</h3>
                    <p>The Temple Mount is located in East Jerusalem's Old City, with the third holiest site in Islam, the al-Aqsa Mosque being located on Temple Mount. This was the site of contention which sparked the <a href="#2021 Israel-Palestine crisis">2021 Israel-Palestine crisis</a>. Jews are not allowed up onto the Temple Mount although many right-wing extremist Jewish groups often call for Jews to gather en masse on Temple Mount for religious purposes (e.g. During Passover, to sacrifice a goat on Temple Mount). This would draw condemnation from Hamas and other Palestinian factions, who would call for Palestinians to "storm" and protect al-Aqsa Mosque. TLDR: Jewish and Muslim holy site, both ultra religious ppl try to "assert" their control over the territory, resulting in clashes.</p>
                    <h3 id="Sheikh Jarrah">Sheikh Jarrah</h3>
                    <p>Sheikh Jarrah is located in East Jerusalem, and is another site of contention as the Israeli court have ruled to evict several Palestinian families and to let Jewish families move in. This drew many Palestinians to gather at Sheikh Jarrah to protest the Isareli court ruling. Far right Israelis joined the protest and clashes broke out between the two sides. This is also partially what caused the <a href="#2021 Israel-Palestine crisis">2021 Israel-Palestine crisis</a>.</p>
                    <h3 id="US Embassy Relocation">US Embassy Relocation</h3>
                    <p>In 2018, the US moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move which has been approved by the US Congress but postponed by the past three US Presidents before Trump. This was a controversial move as it demonstrated US support for Israel, potentially angering and antagonising US relations with other Middle Eastern nations in support of Palestine. This diminished the US' potential as a mediator for peace between Israel and Palestine.</p>
                    <h2 id="Israeli Actions"> Israeli Actions </h2>
                    <h3 id="Israeli Settlements">Israeli Settlements</h3>
                    <p>When Israel won the Six-Day war and controlled the West Bank, Israeli civilians slowly streamed into the West Bank and started establishing settlements there. Part of the reason this happened is that the West Bank is essentially the ancient regions of Judea and Samaria, which hold religious significance to Jews. The Israeli state gradually supported the settlement movement, investing resources into developing the infrastructure of these Jewish communities in the West Bank. At present, Jewish settlements are built across the West Bank, interweaving with many Palestinian communities, resulting in complications for the negotiations of a two-state negotiation as it would have to take into account these Jewish settlements saturated across the Palestinian land. However as these settlements develop, they have become more attractive for Israeli civilians to relocate to, with improved quality of life due to developed infrastructure, cheaper prices and relative proximity to Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p> On a side note, not exactly completely related but in 1993, the Oslo accords (see <a href=middle-east.html#Oslo%20Accords>here</a>) resulted in the West Bank being partitioned into three zones, Area A with Palestinian civil and security control, Area B with Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, and Area C with Israeli civil and security control. The figure below shows the areas on a map, demonstrating how fractured Palestinian control is, resulting in inconvenience as Palestinians have to undergo inspections at checkpoints and are restricted from resources over the large Area C </p>

                    </figure>
                    <h3 id="Annexation of West Bank">Annexation of West Bank</h3>
                    <p>Former Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu proposed to annex areas of the West Bank, essentially expanding Israeli territory to cover parts of the West Bank. Many proposals have been made for the annexation, ranging from annexation of Israeli settlements (first mentioned by Netanyahu), Area C of the West Bank (then supported by the current Israeli PM Naftali Bennett) to even annexation of the entire West Bank. In the meantime, the US also offered the so-called "Trump Peace Plan", which was negotiated between the US and Israel without Palestinian participation. This disrupted the Israeli plan for annexation as the US wanted to form a joint committee with Israel to ensure any anenxation matched up with the Trump Peace Plan. Netanyahu set a deadline for annexation by 1 Jul 2020 without any clear plan, but on 29 Jun 2020, coalition partner and then Alternative PM Benjamin Gantz (Yes, alternative PM. Israeli politics is fked and there are many ever changing coalitions being formed resulting in an everchanging political climate. From 2019 to 2021 in the span of two years, 4 elections were held. Netanyahu and Gantz had a deal where the position of PM would rotate between the two of them) announced that the annexation would not happen. The plan was then indefinitely postponed, and with a new Israeli and US government in power, it seems that the potential annexation has been averted.</p>
                    <p>Slightly unrelated but because maps are interesting, below shows the Trump Peace Plan, with the areas of a Palestinian state indicated. </p>

                    <h2 id="2021 Israel-Palestine Crisis">2021 Israel-Palestine Crisis</h2>
                    <p>The crisis was partially triggered by protests over evictions of Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah. Many gathered atop al-Aqsa Mosque for the last Friday prayers of Ramadan, calling for Hamas to strike Israel. Clashes broke out between Palestinians and Israeli police, who stormed al-Aqsa Mosque. This tense period was also marked by Jerusalem Day, a particularly contentious day that commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem after the Six Day War (which obviously is seen as provocative to Palestinians, who see it as a day of conquest). One of the major celebrations is a particularly contentios march held throughout Jerusalem, attended by many far right Jewish nationalists. As a result of all these events, Hamas gave Israel and ultimatum to withdraw forces from Sheikh Jarrah and Temple Mount. When Israel ignored the referendum, Hamas and PIJ launched hundreds of rockets at Israel per day. Israel retaliated by conducting air strikes on the Gaza Strip, claiming that it targeted Hamas ammunition sites, rocket launchers and tunnels. Meanwhile, clashes intensified between Palestinians and Israelis in Israel and the West Bank, particularly in predominantly Arab communities.</p>
                    <p>Despite Hamas' indiscriminate rocket fire and the precisely targeted Israeli air strikes, the Israeli strikes still caused much greater damage, killing many more Palestinian civilians than the Hamas rockets did, in part due to Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system. Both sides drew condemnation from human rights group over their actions: Hamas for its indiscrimnate rocket firing and Israel for a number of strikes that occured with no clear military target found. Eventually after 11 days of fighting, a ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides and rocket fire into Israel have become minimal.</p>
