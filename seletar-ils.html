                    <p class="lead word-wrap"> Singapore and Malaysia had a conflict over the implementation of a Instrument Landing System (ILS) at Seletar Airport. </p>
                </div>

                    <h2 id="Background"> Background </h2>
                    <p> Since 1974, after Malaysia and Singapore signed an airspace agreement, Singapore provides air traffic services to airspace over southern Johor. In 2008, Seletar Airport began undergoing upgrades, with plans to include an Instrument Landing System. An Instrument Landing System provides short range guidance for aircraft to approach the runway using radio waves, essentially helping pilots land even under poor visibility. </p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Plans were presented by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) regarding the implementation of the ILS at Seletar Airport, as the ILS would cover Malaysian airspace over Pasir Gudang. The procedures were subsequently discussed and concerns were addressed.</p>
                    <h2 id="The Conflict"> The Conflict </h2>
                    <p> On 4 Dec 2018, Malaysia's then Minister of Transport Anthony Loke said in a parliamentary session that Malaysia wanted to reclaim airspace that Singapore controlled over southern Johor,  and that Malaysia was going to send two protest notes to Singapore, one regarding the ILS implementation and another regarding the <a href="tuas.html">Tuas Port Limits</a>. Malaysia's side claimed that the ILS implementation would force a shallower flight path and due to Seletar's Airport proximity to Pasir Gudang, it would set height restrictions to buildings and vessels in Pasir Gudang.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p> However, Singapore argued that the numbers used in Malaysia's argument were inaccurate, and that the actual height restrictions were much higher than claimed.

                    </figure>
                    <p> Singapore also said that Malaysia's disagreement to the ILS was just an excuse to reclaim airspace over southern Johor. </p>
                    <h3 id="Pasir Gudang Airspace Restriction"> Pasir Gudang Airspace Restriction </h3>
                    <p> On 25 Dec 2018, Malaysia then published a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), establishing a <b>permanent</b> restricted area in Pasir Gudang airspace for military use. Non-military aircraft is forbidden to enter the area from a height of approximately 600 to 2,000m. There are concerns of its impact over not just the ILS implementation. but also the normal civil aviation operations at Seletar Airport. This was also the area established for military use to Singapore, which would also raise concerns to Singapore.</p>

                    <h2 id="Aftermath"> Aftermath </h2>
                    <p> Foreign ministers of both countries (Saifuddin and Balakrishnan aka lousy school) met and agreed to deescalate the situation. Eventually, it was decided that Singapore would suspend the ILS implementation while Malaysia would suspend the restricted area over Pasir Gudang. The CAAS and CAAM would also cooperate on GPS-based instrument approach procedures for Seletar Airport. Both countries also agreed to work on transferring control of the airspace over southern Johor to Malaysia in stages. </p>
