                    <p> To navigate this site, use the local and international tabs in the navigation bar on the top of this site. The rest of this page will be a short outline of the geopolitical situation/history/current affairs concerning parts of the world. Organisation is really horrible so pls excuse that.</p>
                    <h2 id="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</h2>
                    <h3 id="Singapore"> Singapore </h3>
                    <p> Really you are reading this? Blabla strategically located at the end of the Straits of Malacca, connecting Asia with Europe, means Singapore was a important location from long back in history (think British colony). Singapore is also the only Chinese-majority country in the world outside of Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan), which is why Singapore has focused hard on developing a national identity.</p>
                    <h3 id="Malaysia"> Malaysia </h3>
                    <p> I'm not gonna pretend I understand Malaysia politics, with its vast number of coalitions and 3 different people holding the position of PM in the past 3 years (Mahathir, Muhyiddin and Ismail Sabri Yaakob). Such changes result in inconsistent policies, such as the cancellation of the KL-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project. It is also interesting to note the use of Singapore as a political tool whenever Malaysia faces an unstable political situation (see <a href=seletar-ils.html> Seletar ILS </a> and <a href=#tuas.html> Tuas Port Limits</a>). </p>
                    <p> However, none of the recent conflicts can compare to the tense situation in 1991, during LATGABMA Malindo Darsasa 3AB (Joint bilateral exercise between Malaysia and Indonesia), which concluded with an airborne assault exercise (airdrop of paratroopers) in southern Johor on Singapore's National Day.
                    <p> Malaysia is also a South China Sea claimant state given its territory of East Malaysia on Borneo, thus putting it into some type of conflict with China (which is going to be a recurring common theme for many other nations). </p>
                    <h3 id="Indonesia"> Indonesia </h3>
                    <p> Country with the largest Muslim population in the world. Together with Malaysia, they "encircle" Singapore, thus making diplomatic relations between Singapore and its two neighbours imperative. Indonesia is a massive archipelagic country spanning a huge distance, with a shit ton of ethnic groups, making it impressive that the Indonesian government manages to govern all those islands. </p>
                    <p> Indonesia also faces the following problems: </p>
                    <ul class = "body-list">
                        <li> Overlap of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with China's South China Sea (SCS) claims </li>
                        <li> Armed conflict with separatists groups in Papua </li>
                        <li> High number of terrorist attacks (Bali bombing, Surabaya bombing, Makassar bombing, Jakarta attacks). Notable groups include JI (Mas Selamat was part of JI) and JAD. There was also the plot to fire a rocket at MBS. </li>
                        <li> High frequency of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, being on the Ring of Fire </li>
                        <li> Jakarta becoming overpopulated and sinking, hence the formation of a new capital Nusantara in East Kalimantan.
                    </ul>
                    <p> Indonesia fought against the Dutch for control over Indonesia after the Japanese surrendered at the end of World War II. It was however difficult to maintain unity after the goal of independence had been achieved, with the communists, military and Islamists having competing interests. During this period, Indonesia also opposed the formation of Malaysia, especially the territories of East Malaysia being incorporated into Malaysia. This started the Konfrantasi, of which the most notable event in Singapore would be the MacDonald House bombing (A warship was later named by Indonesia in 2014 after the perpetrators of the bombing. There was then a controversy over the naming and Singapore banned the vessel KRI Usman-Harun from its ports). </p>
                    <p> In 1965, a failed coup was blamed on the communists, resulting in the military's purge of the communists. GEN Suharto, commander of the Indonesian military (TNI) then consolidated power and began his 31-year long presidency in 1967. Suharto held a tight grip on power and was widely regarded as a dictator. His rule also resulted in discrimination of Indonesian Chinese, ending in 1998 in part due to huge anti-Chinese protests breaking out across Indonesia. Suharto's anti-Chinese policies also resulted in the adoption of Indonesian-sounding Chinese surnames (e.g. Hartono).
                    <p> Indonesia and Singapore also has conflicts over control of the flight information region (FIR) over the Riau Islands (KEPRI), Indonesia. A flight information region is an area of airspace where flight information services to civil aircraft are provided to ensure aviation safety and efficiency. Thus, FIR is not related to sovereignty, and Singapore was granted control over the Riau Islands FIR in 1946 due to its better infrastructure (and retained it ever since). Indonesia has then raised concerns over Singapore's control of the FIR: (i) Singapore benefits from air navigation charges (airlines pay for flight information services); (ii) Indonesia is required to inform Singapore before conducting military exercises in the area (its own sovereign territory); (iii) Indonesia is not informed of SG's military exercises within the area. Meanwhile, Singapore's side says that all air navigation charges were sent to Indonesia, and that Singapore has the responsibility to ensure aviation safety hence requiring prior notification before Indonesia conducts exercises over its airspace. This FIR disagreement has also been used by Indonesian politicians as a way to rally the people by claiming that Singapore was violating Indonesia's sovereignty. In Jan 2022, during the Singapore-Indonesia Leaders' Retreat in Bintan, Singapore and Indonesia agreed to realign the FIR, sign a military agreement for Singapore to conduct exercises in Indonesia, and an extradition treaty. These three issues have been commonly debated in the past (especially as a package), with Indonesia being particularly interested in the extradition bill due to people who embezzled funds during the 1997 Asian financial crisis and escaped to Singapore.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia also had a submarine that sank in 2021 (KRI Nanggala), horrible tsunami in 2004, and ok that's about it.</p>
                    <h3 id="Thailand"> Thailand </h3>
                    <p> Thailand has had a long history of military coups, along with Thailand being a constitutional monarchy complicates the poltiical situation. Thailand's current PM is Prayut Chan-o-cha, who was the Royal Thai Army Commander when he led the 2014 coup. Prayut held onto power after the 2019 election, which was widely seen as biased towards the military junta. Pro-democracy protests broke out in 2020 and have still been ongoing, particularly calling for reforms to the monarchy and lèse majesté laws. </p>
                    <h3 id="Vietnam"> Vietnam </h3>
                    <p> Vietnam is a one-party socialist country, making the Communist Party General Secretary arguably the most powerful person rather than the President or PM. Vietnam also has territorial disputes with China over the South China Sea (SCS). </p>
                    <h3 id="Laos"> Laos </h3>
                    <p> Only landlocked country in SEA, basically a mini Vietnam, also a socialist state. </p>
                    <h3 id="Cambodia"> Cambodia </h3>
                    <p> One of China's closer ally in SEA, with some controversy regarding Ream Naval Base. </p>
                    <h3 id="Myanmar"> Myanmar </h3>
                    <p> On 1 Feb 2021, Myanmar's military (Tatmadaw) detained democratically elected leaders of Myanmar (1 Feb was the day Myanmar's parliament was supposed to convene), over claims of electoral fraud during the Nov 2020 general election. A year long state of emergency was declared, which was recently extended by another 6 months on 31 Jan 2022. In response to the coup, Myanmar citizens held protests, a civil disobedience movement and even engaged in armed conflict against the military junta.</p>
                    <p> Myanmar has long been an unstable country since its independence, due to the existence of multiple ethnic groups fighting for independence. Ceasefire agreements were signed with several of these ethnic armed organisations, but hostilities resumed once again following the coup.
                    <h3 id="Philippines"> Philippines </h3>
                    <p> The Philippines has strong relations with the US, with a defence treaty which dictates that both nations would asisst one another in the event that one of them gets attacked. However, the Philippines has pivoted towards China as an ally following President Rodrigo Duterte's rule. However, relations with China is hard to balance due to the Philippines also have an ongoing territorial dispute with China over the South China Sea. </p>
                    <p> Filipino politicians are also very entertaining, with Duterte frequently using "putang ina mo" and Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. calling a Saudi Arabian a "camel fucker" and calling on China to "GET THE FUCK OUT". </p>
                    <p> Although the Philippines is a largely Christian country, down South closer to Borneo sees a large Muslim population. There have been many separatist groups fighting against the Philippine government in Mindanao, one of which is named MILF. The Philippines also claims part of East Malaysia due to it being previously ruled by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 2013, one of the claimants to the throne of the Sultanate of Sulu launched an invasion to assert his claims. Approximately 200 militants took over a fishing village (yes, that's the invasion). There was a standoff and the fighting ended with the sultan calling for a ceasefire after realising it was a lost cause. </p>
                    <h3 id="Brunei"> Brunei </h3>
                    <p> Muslim Singapore. </p>
                    <h3 id="Timor-Leste"> Timor-Leste </h3>
                    <p> Who? But honestly really nothing much. It just gained independence from Indonesia in 2002, a few years after Indonesia's former president Suharto resigned. </p>
                    <h2 id="Asia-Pacific Region">Asia-Pacific Region</h2>
                    <h3 id="Australia"> Australia </h3>
                    <p> Kangaroos. Honestly though Australia is so massive and empty. Perth is one of the most isolated cities in the world, and is closer to Jakarta than Sydney. Australia also lost a war to emus. They built a capital territory because they couldn't choose between Sydney and Melbourne to be the capital. </p>
                    <h3 id="New Zealand"> New Zealand </h3>
                    <p> Mini Australia. Christchurch kinda cursed place with earthquake and shooting. Oh and recently they had an anti-COVID vaccine mandate protest outside the parliament, camped over there for more than a week already (inspired by the Canada truckers). The parliament then decided play songs like Let It Go, Baby Shark and recorder version of My Heart Will Go On, trying to deter protesters (idk how that would work). Honestly the whole protest was more like a carnival, with music, food trucks and tents. They also turned on sprinklers to chase protesters from the field.</p>
                    <h3 id="China"> China </h3>
                    <p> Ok this dude has problems with half the world. So that would be covered on the parts with half the world. Internally, it faces controversies its treatment of Uyghurs. China does not really see any protests (well the last time they protested in 1989, uhm...). OK there are protests in Hong Kong. So the incident started like this: </p>
                    <p> A dude from Hong Kong went Taiwan on vacation with his girlfriend and murdered her. But cos Taiwan-China u know, authorities in Hong Kong couldn't do shit, and could only charge the guy for stealing from his dead girlfriend. Fked up right. Anyways so Hong Kong wanted to modify their extradition bill so there could be a case-by-case transfer of fugitive. But this bill included China, and given China's track record of clamping down on political opponents/dissent, protests were sparked. </p>
                    <p> Alright no more dissing China otherwise -20 social credit score.</p>
                    <h3 id="Taiwan"> Taiwan </h3>
                    <p> I love Taiwan. Taiwanese food second only to Japanese. Taiwan also has quite strong Japanese influence because it was under Japanese rule since 1895 after the Sino-Japanese war. Incidentally, Taiwan has same birthday as me so there's that. For more regarding Taiwan and China, see <a href=taiwan.html>here</a>. </p>
                    <h3 id="Korea"> Korean Peninsula </h3>
                    <p> OK I'm just gonna lump the 2 Koreas together. S. Korea has a strong influence culturally (K-pop, kdrama). In fact, S.Korea's cultural influence is so strong that Kim Jung-un labelled K-pop a "vicious cancer". Meanwhile, N. Korea culture is... worshipping Kim Jong-un? idk. </p>
                    <p> Anyways so history. After WWII (Korea was annexed by Japan previously), Korea was divided between the Soviet Union (USSR) and the US. However, due to worsening relations during the Cold War, the reunification of Korea never happened and resulted in the current standoff across the DMZ. N. Korea's biggest controversy would be its nuclear and missile programmes. The threat of a unpredictable leader in Kim Jong-un with weapons of mass destruction greatly threaten the security of the region. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) have passed several resolutions against N. Korea. To counter the N. Korean threat, the US stations troops in S. Korea, conduct joint military exercises and have imposed and led to the imposition of multiple sanctions on N. Korea. </p>
                    <p> In 2022, N. Korea began stepping up its missile tests, conducting seven such tests in Jan alone (record number of missile tests in a month), which included claims of a hypersonic missile launch and an intermediate range ballistic missile capable of hitting the US territory of Guam (the missiles are normally fired at a higher angle to limit its range). </p>
                    <p> It would be interesting to see how the situation develops, whether Kim is flexing its muscles to bring the US back on the negotiation table and whether such developments are indeed for self-defence or if Kim truly believes in his capability and intends to reunite the Korean Peninsula. Any US bolstering of forces and deployment of missile capabilities and assets would certainly also draw the ire of China, who views N. Korea as a useful buffer between China and a major US ally in S. Korea. </p>
                    <h3 id="Japan"> Japan </h3>
                    <p> Best food and don't even argue u imbeciles. Infamous for its involvement in WWII (one of the worst crimes Japan ever committed, second only to anime), it is currently a major US ally. Interestingly, its constitution limits Japan's military to be used only for self-defence, hence the name "Japan Self-Defense Forces" as its name. Japan also has territorial disputes with China over the Senkaku Islands.</p>
                    <h3 id="India"> India </h3>
                    <p> Border conflict with China, both on its northeastern and northwestern side. There was a fistfight between Indian and Chinese troops at Ladakh, resulting in multiple injuries and deaths. The area of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir is a complicated region of conflicting border disputes between India, Pakistan and China, three great nuclear powers. </p>
                    <h3 id="Pakistan"> Pakistan </h3>
                    <p> Basically Muslim India. Oh and the tiktok meme.</p>
                    <p> Back during the era of British India, much of the entire Indian subcontinent, including Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, were under British rule. When British India gained independence, the British divided the region into two, a Muslim majority Pakistan and a Hindu-majority India. However, one state, Jammu and Kashmir chose to stay neutral due to its Muslim majority population but Hindu monarch. However, rebellions were sparked in fears that the Jammu and Kashmir would join India. Pakistani militants soon joined the fight, while the monarch sought help from India, resulting in conflict between India and Pakistan. A ceasefire was met and the region was split into Indian and Pakistani control. There have however been insurgencies in the Indian-controlled region, while Pakistan is accused of supporting the insurgents and also conducting terrorist attacks within India, while India harshly cracks down on the insurgencies and protests against Indian rule.</p>
                    <h3 id="Bangladesh"> Bangladesh </h3>
                    <p> Bangladesh was a Pakistani province back when British India was carved up. However, due to various reasons it fought for independence against Pakistan with the help of India and gained independence in 1972. </p>
                    <h3 id="Afghanistan"> Afghanistan </h3>
                    <p> US invaded in 2001 after the September 11 attacks as the Taliban harboured al-Qaeda. However, the Taliban hid for 20 years and regained power after US left. Due to the Taliban's rise to power, foreign aid into Afghanistan have been frozen, creating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIFi_Rgm-T8" target="none">humanitarian crisis</a>.</p>
                    <h2 id="Europe">Europe</h2>
                    <h3 id="Russia"> Russia </h3>
                    <p class = "inline">
                        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="putinbutton">Putin</button>
                        <span id="putin"> </span>
                    </p>
                    <p> But legit dont fk with Vladimir Putin. His control over the media, elections and judiciary makes it difficult for him to lose power. However, a young lawyer named Alexei Navalny conducted investigations and exposed Putin's and other Russian officials' corruption, leading to mass protests across the nation. Navalny also came up with a voting strategy that would consolidate all anti-Putin votes into one opposition candidate (Putin creates multiple fake candidates in elections to splinter the opposition vote). In 2020, Navalny was poisoned by a Soviet nerve agent and was medically evacuated to Berlin. After he recovered, he had the balls to fly back to Russia. His flight was diverted and Navalny was jailed, sparking more protests in Russia. </p>
                    <p> Russia also has a conflict with Ukraine. In 2014, pro-Russian Ukranian leader was ousted after protests were held against his pivot to Russia instead of the European Union (EU). However, pro-Russian protests were held after a new president was elected, and Russia invaded and annexed (claimed as territory) Crimea (part of Ukraine). Other regions also see pro-Russian separatist groups backed by Russia fighting against the Ukrainian government (MH17 was shot down as part of this conflict). </p>
                    <p> Now, Russia has been building up lots of assets and personnel at the Russia-Ukraine border. Russia has also demanded that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a military alliance between the US and several European nations largely an artifact from the Cold War, stop expanding to include more members. Russia views Ukraine as kind of part of the same unit, both being part of the Soviet Union with close cultural ties and overlaps, and is reluctant to see Ukraine being influenced by the West (basically the clingy ex). The US and UK, among other countries have withdrawn families of diplomatic missions personnel (edit: looks like US is evacuating embassy staff now), while NATO have deployed more troops into Eastern Europe. We will have to see if the situation escalates or if both sides can come up with a deal to deescalate the situation. </p>
                    <p>Edit #2: Well looks like shit got even worse, fighting breaking out at the pro-Russian separatist-ruled region of Ukraine, breaking the ceasefire. Civilians are being evacuated to Russia as artillery strikes and explosions can be heard, and an open mobilisation was declared in the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) and Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) (separatist states in Ukraine). NATO leaders accused Russia of using the attacks as a pretext to invade Ukraine and claimed that intelligence reveal that an invasion was imminent. Interesting to see how this develops.</p>
                    <p>[Random sidenote: Ukraines's current President was an actor who acted as Ukraine's President in a TV show. (The political party was named after the TV show)]</p>
                    <p>Edit #3: Well looks like shit got EVEN worse. Putin signed a decree recognising the LPR and DPR. This has drawn wide condemnation by Western and NATO nations, with the EU and US imposing sanctions. The UNSC held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation, which got kinda weird since the Russian Ambassador to UN was the UNSC President for the month. so the Russian Ambassador gotta thank everyone for their statements condemning Russia, and after the Ukranian Ambassador gave his statement, the Russian Ambassador said "As President of the UNSC, I am obliged to say this. Thank you for the statement."</p>
                    <p>Edit #4: Putin launched a "special military operation" in Ukraine. OK im not updating it anymore but essentially invasion happenning.</p>
                    <p> China is certainly looking at how the US would respond, which could set a precedence for US response in the occasion of an invasion of Taiwan.</p>
                    <h3 id="Belarus"> Belarus </h3>
                    <p> Belarus is a close ally of Russia, with its president Alexander Lukashenko being president since the USSR was dissolved. Lukashenko is often known as "Europe's last dictator". Following the 2020 elections, protests were sparked over Lukashenko being declared as winner, with Lukashenko cracking down harshly on the protests. Several nations do not recognise the results of the 2020 elections and widely condemned the violation of human rights in Belarus. </p>
                    <p> In his own right, Lukashenko is basically like a mini Putin. Belarus diverted a flight bound from Athens, Greece to Vilnius, Lithuania, claiming that there was a bomb on the plane and diverted the flight to Minsk, Belarus (although Vilnius was closer than Minsk lmao) to arrest a political opponent. </p>
                    <p> Belarus also created a refugee crisis on its borders with the EU. Migrants, largely from the Middle East were offered visas with the promise that they were able to cross over into the EU (especially Poland). However, the Polish border guards held the refugess back, while Belarusian border guards refused to allow migrants to leave.</p>
                    <h3 id="UK"> UK </h3>
                    <p> UK PM Boris Johnson might be in trouble after several parties were held at the PM residence on 10 Downing Street, flouting lockdown rules.</p>
                    <h3 id="Rest of Europe""> Rest of Europe </h3>
                    <p> Ok honestly i don't know shit about Europe man, it just seems like such a poltically and culturally integrated area. Europe is also a common place for unrest, including protests (COVID restrictions, yellow vests movement, environmental activists, etc.) and terrorist attacks, particularly in France (Charlie Hebdo, 2015 Paris attacks, 2016 Nice truck attack).</p>
